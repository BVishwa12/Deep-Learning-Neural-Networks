# Deep Learning & Neural Networks Projects 🚀

Welcome to the **Deep Learning & Neural Networks** repository! Here, we showcase a collection of fascinating projects powered by **Neural Networks (NN)**. Whether you're interested in **Customer Churn Prediction**, **Image Processing with CNN**, or exploring upcoming projects with **RNN**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **GANs**, there's something here for everyone! 

This repository not only includes major deep learning projects but also smaller, fun implementations to help you understand and experiment with the power of NNs. Let's dive in!

## 🚀 Projects in this Repository

### 1. **Customer Churn Prediction with ANN**
This is a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a bank using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The model is trained using customer data, and a Streamlit web application allows users to interact with the model and make predictions.
- **Key Files**:
  - `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset used for training the model
  - `model.h5`: Pre-trained ANN model
  - `label_encoder_gender.pkl`, `onehot_encoder_geo.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`: Tools for data preprocessing
  - `app.py`: Streamlit app for real-time customer churn predictions

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Processing**
This project focuses on image processing using **CNN**. The notebook demonstrates how to apply convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling operations on images.
- **Key Files**:
  - `image.jpg`: Example image for CNN processing
  - `CNN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showcasing CNN operations

### 3. **Feedforward Neural Network for MNIST**
A classic neural network project using a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Perfect for anyone getting started with deep learning!
- **Key File**:
  - `Feedforward_NN_MNIST.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the classification task

### 4. **Upcoming Projects**
We’re not stopping here! Exciting new projects are on the way:
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: We’ll dive into sequential data processing, like time-series forecasting and natural language processing (NLP).
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Building intelligent agents that learn through interaction with their environment.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Exploring image generation and synthetic data creation with GANs.
